First attempt to try and get the original [Not Keeper's Needs mod](https://github.com/Hy60koshk/GraveKeeper-NotKeepersNeeds) working again

:: COMPATIBILITY ::
* Graveyard Keeper 1.402

* Game timescale
* Price inflation control
* Default character speed
* Energy drain and regen
* Health damage and regen
* Tech orbs drop amount
* Crafting speed
* All interactions speed (probably unstable)

    * Configurable speed when sprinting
    * The key to use sprint (LeftShift by default, but you can set any value that Unity can parse as a KeyCode)
    * Toggle/hold sprint key
    * Energy cost for sprinting
* Hotkeys to
    * Add gold coins

:: Configuration ::
There's a configuration tool included in the main archive. It will help you to set mod options the way you'd like.
Run the configuration tool from %game_path%\QMods\NotKeepersNeeds folder to edit existing settings.
Run it from any other folder or just delete the existing config.txt to run the configurator with all defaults.

And here's the [Article](https://www.nexusmods.com/graveyardkeeper/articles/2) on how to manually configure every aspect of the mod.

:: INSTALLATION ::
1. Install this mod like any other mod for QModManager.
2. Configure the mod using NKN-Configurator.exe in your mod folder, or manually by editing the config.txt.
